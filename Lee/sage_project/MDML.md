### MDML (Manufacturing Data and Machine Learning) Platform

- The Manufacturing Data and Machine Learning (MDML) platform standardizes the research and operational environment for advanced data analytics to enable automated, MLdriven optimization.
- MDML is designed to support in situ measurements for accelerating scalable materials manufacturing and to enable the integration of ML and HPC resources into the experimental process.
- MDML enables users to construct rich, data-oriented analysis pipelines that span disparate computational environments, from laptops and local servers to supercomputers and clouds. 
- Finally, MDML leverages industry standard visualization and monitoring tools to create dynamic interfaces to experimental facilities and their processing pipelines.
