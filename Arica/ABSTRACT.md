## Kenan Arica Summer 2021 Abstract

SAGE is a NSF-funded grant dedicated to implementing edge computating into the existing remote-sensing Waggle platform. Users of many organizations may use the SAGE/Waggle platform for a variety of different purposes, and may very well use an original set of peripherals to accomplish their goals. As it stands, functionality to control node fleets is relatively scarce. To save time, and increase efficiency when applying upgrades to peripheral configurations on nodes (such as a camera, LIDAR, network switch), Kenan Arica spent his Summer 2021 internship architecting and building a system for autonomous, modular peripheral upgrades across nodes, called Honeycomb, as well as assisting the SAGE software team and doing minor research on fault tolerance strategies. While unfinished, Honeycomb offers a promising attempt to bridge node configuration management and human interaction in a way suitable for all users of the SAGE/Waggle platform.
