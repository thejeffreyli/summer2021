ABSTRACT = {Videos represent the primary source of information for surveillance applications. Video material is often available in large quantities but in most cases it contains little or no annotation for supervised learning. This article reviews the state-of-the-art deep learning based methods for video anomaly detection and categorizes them based on the type of model and criteria of detection. We also perform simple studies to understand the different approaches and provide the criteria of evaluation for spatio-temporal anomaly detection.},

abstract = {Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are expressive latent variable models that can be
used to learn complex probability distributions from training data. However, the quality
of the resulting model crucially relies on the expressiveness of the inference model.
We introduce Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB), a technique for training Variational
Autoencoders with arbitrarily expressive inference models. We achieve this by introducing
an auxiliary discriminative network that allows to rephrase the maximum-likelihood-problem
as a two-player game, hence establishing a principled connection between VAEs and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We show that in the nonparametric limit our
method yields an exact maximum-likelihood assignment for the parameters of the generative
model, as well as the exact posterior distribution over the latent variables given
an observation. Contrary to competing approaches which combine VAEs with GANs, our
approach has a clear theoretical justification, retains most advantages of standard
Variational Autoencoders and is easy to implement.},
