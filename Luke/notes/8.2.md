## Notes

- Figuring out how to adapt Colin's plugin to the nvidia NX. So far I have edited the Dockerfile to change the plugin-base version and architecture. 

  - Now plugin-base is this:
  
    ```
    waggle/plugin-base:1.1.1-ml-cuda10.2-l4t
    ```
  
  - The run command is:
  
    ```
    sudo docker run --runtime nvidia --network host -v /home/nvidia/luke_projects/config_dir/data-config.json:/run/waggle/data-config.json -v /home/nvidia/luke_projects/dataset/neon-samples:/dataset plugin-anomaly-detector --stream top_live --data /dataset --interval 1 --buffsize 5
    ```
  
  - It looks like I might have to add more swap to the device because the model, a 960x1280x3 tensor, is too much to store just in RAM on the device.
  
- Finished up my presentation recording and uploaded slides to the students Box folder
