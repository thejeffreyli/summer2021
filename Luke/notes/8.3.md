## Notes

- ECR Meeting Notes (Yomi's last)
  - I am going to continue to work on my presentation
  - Testing out Colin's plugin to see if I can get it to run with my live metrics probes
    - His model uses ~8GB of memory
  - At Yomi's service to help him figure out the database
    - Probably don't have time to figure out the Prometheus interface

- Conferences that are suitable for a paper
  - Ubicomp conference? (Wait till 2022)
- Meeting with Dr. Hillebrand
  - What are the biggest projects you are overseeing at the moment?
  - Who are the beneficiaries of your research division? So when Argonne advances a new technology, how does that benefit American consumers?
  - Your bio on Argonne says you worked at Daimler Research in Germany for a little while. I have wondered what research in the private sector is like. What similarities or differences do you see working for Argonne as opposed to your previous industry research?
  - What is the current state of the automotive industry in the U.S. and what are your thoughts on Tesla's work with electric cars?
