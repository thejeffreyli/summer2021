## Notes

- I have setup a working prototype of the pipeline. Now I just need to integrate it into Yomi's database and write code for post-processing. I don't know on which device we will perform the post-processing. I could implement it on either the NX or the Jenkins server side. I will try to implement it on the NX as a part of the profiling script, just so we don't have to transfer the raw files. (Although post-processing might make the files larger if we are encoding them with timestamps and in JSON format.)

- Arguments given to all steps of the process
  - <u>Jenkinsfile build parameters</u>
