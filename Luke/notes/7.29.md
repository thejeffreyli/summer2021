## Notes

- Wrote my general audience abstract

- Working on my final presentation outline
  - Introduce Sage Project goals
    - Give scientists easy-to-use tools and cyberinfrastructure for their science
    - Process data at the edge first
  - Edge Apps
    - Developed by scientists to sense the environment and make predictions
    - Apps need to run on many nodes
    - Similarly, many apps will run on a given node, which requires automated coordination and planning 
  - Performance Profiler - assesses the "historic performance" of an app
    - Show how it works across multiple agents (the ECR and testbed working together)
    - Explain how the metrics will be used to "fit" plugins together like jigsaw pieces
  - Compare and contrast historic vs. live performance
  - Describe live performance setup with diagram
  - Describe novelty of overall software development of profilers (historic and live)
    - The edge is a new paradigm that has incredible potential
    - When we can coordinate the deployment of all apps according to the needs of scientists
  
- Tried to get Colin's plugin to work on the NX. Had to change the waggle-base to the L4T version, and I am still struggling to fix this error:

  ```
  RuntimeError: could not open camera at "http://localhost:8090/top/live.mp4"
  ```
