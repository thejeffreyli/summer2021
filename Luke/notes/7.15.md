## Notes

- Enabled a parameterized build of the Jenkins pipeline which allows an API request to specify the arguments to be sent to the app, which app to profile, and other docker args for running the app.
- There exists a Jenkins agent docker image, but it does not have a build for arm64 architectures. Theoretically I could compile the Jenkins agent code for the NX, but I may be able to assume that Jenkins is installed natively on the target NX's.
