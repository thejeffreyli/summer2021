## Literature Review for Research Paper

- What makes this pipeline unique? What makes the live profiling setup unique?
  - *A Double Deep Q-Learning Model for Energy-Efficient Edge Scheduling*
    - Cyber-physical-social systems is the broader category that contains IoT
    - Because edge devices often use batteries or rely on low-output power sources, reducing the dynamic power usage of a system with scheduling techniques is of importance to engineers.
    - A double deep Q-learning model is used for edge scheduling
      - The "knobs" are the DVFS algorithm frequency and voltage values
  - *Addressing Application Latency Requirements through Edge Scheduling*
    - They propose a scheduling algorithm that addresses latency, but they focus on networking, not multi-tenancy
  - *PiCasso: Enabling information-centric multi-tenancy at the edge of community mesh networks*
    - Also specializing in networking
  - *Reinforcement learning-based controller for adaptive workflow scheduling in multi-tenant cloud computing*
    - Math-heavy paper describing a model of cloud computing and how to schedule jobs and scale resources. Describes multi-tenancy with two paradigms: Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Software-as-a-Service.
  - *Image classification on IoT edge devices: profiling and modeling*
