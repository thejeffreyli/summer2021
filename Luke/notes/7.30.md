## To Do

- Finalize presentation slides by the end of the day so that on Monday I can practice speaking over them and then eventually record myself for the Monday deadline

- Make Prometheus integration code more robust and test it further

  - Gather some real plugins and test datasets from other interns

    - Write up a specification for plugin-makers to specify a profiling dataset

      ```
      source:
        architectures:
          - "linux/amd64"
          - "linux/arm64"
          - "linux/arm/v7"
        url: "https://github.com/EnriqueNueve/UrbanAudioPlugin"
        testing:
          command: [test.py]
        profiling:
        	dataset: <Link to Sage object storage server>
          command: [main.py, --input, /path/to/profiling/dataset]
      ```

      

    - To best test my profiling hooks I will need to apply them to the source code of an app that requires a certain minimum framerate for operation. There is not much of a point to insert my profiling hooks into a single-image-processing plugin, because that doesn't require a 

- Write my own plugin readme
