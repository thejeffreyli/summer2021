In our modern age, data is the life-blood of any respectable science. To perform their work most effectively, scientists need to have access to a system that collects data that is relevant to their field. The Sage team addresses this problem by providing scientists access to a wide network of sensor nodes. Scientists can harness the power of this network by deploying AI applications onto many nodes at once. However, it is a difficult problem to manage the execution of these AI applications on a single node. 

During my time at Argonne National Lab, I collaborated with a team of researchers within the Sage group to develop performance profiling tools for AI applications. 



These tools monitor and report the resource usage of apps running on Sage nodes, multipurpose computer systems that have been deployed everywhere, from urban intersections to wildlife preserves. Without these profiling tools, there is no predicting the performance impact of running a particular app on this computer system. Because scientists will want to run multiple apps on the device, 

These tools will be essential to the smooth operation of AI applications running on sensor nodes throughout the country. The problem I addressed was a lack of automation in
