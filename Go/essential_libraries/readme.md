## IMPORTANT
This folder contains all of the libraries needed to make the arduino sketches work. I have made some changes to these libraries to work with the system I have set up; it is important that you get the libraries from this directory and not from some other website.
Additionally, you will need the following board definitions:
- SX127x
- SX126x
- Apollo3 MCU
- ESP32 MCU
