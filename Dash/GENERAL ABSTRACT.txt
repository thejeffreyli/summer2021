I explored the creation and use of machine learning models to predict solar irradiance and lifted condensation level(LCL) from local weather data and thermal images. 
The datasets were taken from the NCEI Local Climatological database, a pyrometer setup at Argonne National Laboratory, and a set of thermal images, also taken at 
Argonne National Laboratory. Several models from Pytorch, Tensorflow,/Keras, and Scikit-learn were created in order to predict the LCL pressure and LCL temperature, 
the two values that could be calculated, as well as the net irradiance(the amount of radiance that reaches the ground) and global irradiance(the total amount of irradiance). 
For LCL pressure, the best performing model (accuracy=.997)was a Keras Functional(accuracy = .977) used the relative humidity, the sea level pressure, and the wet bulb 
temperature along with the thermal images. For LCL temperature, the best performing model was a Keras Sequential model that only used relative humidity, sea level pressure, and
wet bulb temperature. For net irradiance, the best performing model(accuracy=.948)used the data collected along with the pyrometer along with the thermal images, and the best 
performing model for the global irradiance(accuracy=.925) took all the data. The models require very little data in order to calculate values that normally take specialized 
equipment. In the future, thesecould potentially be integrated into a system in their respective areas of need in order to faster and more accurately compute needed 
meteorological information. I hope you find this useful.
