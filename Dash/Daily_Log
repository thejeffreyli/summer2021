June 18th
Clouds Meeting, Student Seminar
Worked on presentation
worked on extracting ASOS station data
June 19th
Implemented sklearn
Received 62.5% accuracy
worked on procesing images and corresponding csvs to determine season from picture
June 20th
Gave presentation
Re-learned Pytorch
June 21st
Gave student presentation on my topic
worked on converting the RAW files to jpg
continued learning Pytorch
Started to write the code
June 22nd
continued to learn more Pytorch
Implemented the Pytorch model on the images
48.8% accuracy
worked on improving model
June 23rd
Implemented the Pytorch model on just the trees
Lower accuracy
worked on moving ASOS data 
June 24th:
Attended Clouds meeting
Attended plugin seminar
Continued learning regression through Pytorch
June 25th:
Implemented the ASOS data into the Pytorch model 
Obtained 62% accuracy
Continued to implement the regression model
Investigated the possibility of calculating LCL 
Read literature into forecasting LCL'

June 28th:
Downloaded ASOS Data(10 years worth of entries from an air force base in IL)
Processed data and calculated LCL 
Looked for ML algorithms

June 29th
Continued looking for ML algorithms
Narrowed down the features to use for designing the model
Visualized Data
Looked over FLIRCamera

June 30th
Successfully tested 7 models and found one with 99% accuracy for both LCL pressure and temperature
Analyzed model to make sure it wasn't a fluke

July 1st:
Attended clouds meeting
Started processing thermal images
Looking for best ML algorithm for analyzing the images
Reviewed related literature

July 2nd:
Worked on linking the thermal images to the the arrays
Created tensorflow model to predict the rgb array of images
Got image- did not work
Continuecd to try to work on it


July 4rd
Moved on from imaging- link for turning one into another was not clear
Downloaded large set of images and asos data and started to process it

July 5th
Continued to process thermal image data into arrays
Created image out of thermal data -  to tell which part of the given array was a tree, soil, sky or grass

July 6th 
Isolated useful parts of the asos data
Started to create tensorflow model

July 7th
Continued to create tensorflow model
Low accuracy for thermal image data

July 8th 
added asos data -  successful!
narrowed down necessary paratemers to predict LCL

July 9th
Created tensorflow model tested on various features
relative humidity, sea level pressure, wet bulb temperature most important
95% overall accuracy
e- 59% without the humidity
2:33
-84% without temperature -85% percent without pressure and 80% without wind
2:34
for reference just the thermal images had 64% accuracy (edited

July 12th
Re-processed all the thermal image data
Got all 1500 images in array format

July 13th
Worked on making the Keras Functional model

July 14th
Completed Keras Functional Model just for LCL Pressure
Got 99% explained variance score


July 15th
Attempted to make a similar model for LCL Temperature
Failed to construct model(thermal images don't correlate)
Used three features(relative humidity, sea level pressure, and wet bulb temperature) to get 99% accuracy using sequential model

July 16th
Discussed future steps w/ Jeremy
Did further tests on the model(MAE, RMSE), unsued images


July 19th
Looked for irradiance data
Gave presentation
Worked on finding ASOS sites and processing data
