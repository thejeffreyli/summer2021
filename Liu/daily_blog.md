## Week 2 (May 17 to May 21)

### Monday May 17, 2021
#### Work Done:
 - Paperwork on Tax files
 - Walk through Pytorch tutorials
 - Read papers on anytime DNN ([BranchNet-ICPP-2016](paper-notes/BranchNet-ICPP-2016.md), and [DistributedDNN-ICDCS-2017](paper-notes/DistributedDNN-ICDCS-2017.md))

   - how stochastic gredient decent works
   - backpropogation's prove
   - Implementation codes using SGD and backpropogation

#### Questions and Thoughs for Anytime DNN:

 - Motivation of Anytime DNN: Compared with research activities in building more powerful hardware/accelerators and architectures to speed up the DNN’s inference time, anytime DNN seems to be less competitive. The usage of it seems to be limited to **resource-constraint scenarios** and there is **no penalty for performance degradation**.
 - Contradictions in building anytime DNN: According to Zilberstein’s paper (AAAI-1996), I think one of the core part of anytime algorithm is to set up the relationship between time/resources and results qualities, statistically or theoretically. On the other hand, as a black-box based approach, it is hard to explain how DNN learns, especially **the impact of intermediate results from sub layers**, which makes it hard to set up this kind of relationship between time/resources and results qualities for DNN. 
 - Decompose with applications and dataset: Customized designs for specific application and dataset to make it possible to be anytime is feasible. **The real challenge is to propose a general approach which decomposes with applications and datasets**.

### Wednesday May 19, 2021
#### Work Done:
 - Read research papers on anytime DNN ([IResNext](paper-notes/Lee-Arxiv-2018.md),[BranchNet-ICPP-2016](paper-notes/BranchNet-ICPP-2016.md), and [DistributedDNN-ICDCS-2017](paper-notes/DistributedDNN-ICDCS-2017.md)) 
 - Contine to learn the chapter3 of machine learning book
   - The problem of slow learning for quadratic cost
   - The prove of cross-entropy's impact to solve the slow learning problem
   - The prove of using softmax function with log-likelihood cost to sovle the slow learning problem

### Thursday May 20, 2021
#### Work Done:
 - Finish the chapter3 of machine learning book
   - The problem of overfitting in DNN training, using regulariztion to overcome this problem
     - understand why regularization could reduce overfitting; the impact of using smaller weights than larger weights (weight decay)
     - L1 regularization: the weights shrink by a constant amount toward 0
     - L2 regularization: the weights shrink by an amount which is proportional to weights
   - Dropout: randomly (and temporarily) deleting half the hidden neurons in the network, while leaving the input and output neurons untouched
   - Artificially expanding the training data
     - MNIST: rotations, translating and skewing the images of the dataset
     - speech recognition: adding noisy
 - Learn weight initialization techniques
   - weights and bias: Gaussian random variabales with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
   - modified weights initialization
   - turns out to only accelerate the training process, not improve the model performance
 - How to choose a neural network’s hyper-parameters
 - Variations on stochastic gradient descent
   - Hessian techniques: incorporating information about second-order changes in the cost function
   - Momentum-based gradient descent: introduces a notion of “velocity”
 - Other models of artificial neuron:
   - sigmoid: stop learning when they saturate, i.e., when their output is near either 0 or 1
   - tanh: compute any function39 mapping inputs to the range −1 to 1; stop learning when they saturate 
   - ReLU: increasing the weighted input to a rectified linear unit will never cause it to saturate, and so there is no corresponding learning slowdown. On the other hand, when the weighted input to a rectified linear unit is negative, the gradient vanishes, and so the neuron stops learning entirely.

   - GPU execution mechanism: asynchronous execution; computations executed in parallel
   - GPU warm-up
     - GPU has several power states
     - In lower power state, the GPU shuts down different pieces of hardware, including memory subsystems, internal subsystems, or even compute cores and caches.
     - [Examples code](codes/dnn-time-measure.py)
   - Common mistakes when measuring time
     - Transferring data between the host and the device
       - usually done when a tensor is created on the CPU and inference is then performed on the GPU. 
       - this memory allocation takes a considerable amount of time, which subsequently enlarges the time for inference
     - Not using GPU warm-up
       - GPU initialization can take up to 3 seconds, which makes a huge difference when the timing is in terms of milliseconds.
     - Using standard CPU timing
       - The most common mistake made is to measure time **without synchronization**.
       - ```torch.cuda.synchronize()```
     - Taking one sample
   - Measure throughput
     - estimate the optimal batch size that allows for maximum parallelism
     - given this optimal batch size, we measure the number of instances the network can process in one second.
