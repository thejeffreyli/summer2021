### Submitting Code to ECR: 
Every GitHub repo submitted to ECR should have the ecr-meta folder with the appropriate files. To get started, please download the ecr-meta.zip file 
and uncompress to the root of your project/code repo that will be submitted to ECR. The folder has a README file that describes the use and requirements 
of each file.
