### Submitting Code to ECR: 
Every GitHub repo submitted to ECR should have the `ecr-meta/` folder with the appropriate files. To get started, please download the [ecr-meta.zip](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/summer2021/raw/main/ecr/ecr-meta.zip) file 
and uncompress to the root of your project/code repo that will be submitted to [ECR](https://portal.sagecontinuum.org/apps/explore). The folder has a README file that describes the use and requirements 
of each file.
