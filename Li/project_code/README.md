## Python Programs

This section is dedicated to programs I worked on during the summer. A brief description of each folder is shown below. 

* pole_extraction_algorithm: Distinguishes the foreground object (the snow rod) from the background using tools from OpenCV.
* unet_testing: Generates rod segmentations from U-Net model.
* unet_training: Trains U-Net model with labeled images.
* validation: Calculates mean Interception over Union (mIoU) score.
